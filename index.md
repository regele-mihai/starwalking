# Shooting and processing the Wizard Nebula (NGC 7380)

## Gear

 - EQ3-2 motorized mount
 - SkyWatcher Black Diamond NEQ3 150/750 Newtonian
 - Orion SSAG camera + 50mm guidescope
 - Nikon D5600 astromodified camera
 - Motorized focuser
 - Laptop with Astrophotography Tool and PHD 2

## Setup

I went outside to install my telescope and collimate at about 21:00. The sun was slowly setting, making it a bit hard to align my secondary mirror. After that, collimation was a breeze as I am using a laser collimator.

I connected all my gear, then waited for nightfall.

When the Big Dipper started being visible I polar aligned my scope and used my finderscope to point it in the rough neightborhood of the nebula. I used Delta Cephei and Zeta Cephei as visible guides.

Afterwards I used plate solving to center my scope on the target. I changed the finder scope to the guiding one and set up PHD 2. Its calibration process moved the target a bit, and I repositioned it, taking into account the fact that the edges of my field look a bit weird due to the lack of a flattener.

## Data acquisition

I set up a lights plan in APT. The length for each exposure was 60s, with dithering in between.
